# How to submit your repository

1. ## Staging

   Open the **Git** tab while you are in the repository. You should now see a list of Staged, Changed, Untracked, and Stashed files. Hover over the **Changed** section. This should cause a **"+"** button laveled **"Stage all changes"** to appear. Press this button.

2. ## Commit

   At the bottom of the tab, you will see two text boxes, **Summary** and **Description**. Fill these out and then press the **COMMIT** button. If asked, provide a username and email.

3. ## Push

   You should now have an orange dot next to the **Push** button at the top of the **GIT** tab. This button looks like an upload button and is shaped like a cloud. Press it. You will now have a pop-up asking for a username and **Personal Token**.

4. ## Get The Personal Token

   Go back to your GitHub and navigate to the **Settings** (located in the right bar that appears if you press your profile picture).
    There, navigate to **Developer Settings**, and then **Personal Access Tokens**. In **Tokens (classic)**, press **Generate New Token** and select **Generate New Token (classic)**.
    You can add whatever note you want and give it any expiration date you want (just be aware that once it expires, you will have to regenerate it if you want to still be able to freely use your repos through Qbraid).
    Give it the full **repo** scope, then press generate.
    Make sure to copy the token, as you will not be able to access it again without regenerating it.

5. ## Input The Personal Token

    Now that you have your token, go back to Qbraid and plug it and your GitHub username into the pop-up. You should now have pushed your changes into the repository.

6. ## Check

   Go to your repository on GitHub. You should now see the changes you made on Qbraid there.

7. ## Invite Zhar-Ptitsa

   In your repository, go to the **Settings** tab and go to **Collaborators**. Press **Add Collaborators** and add the user **"Zhar-Ptitsa"** so we can go through your work.
