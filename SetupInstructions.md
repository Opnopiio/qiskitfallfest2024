# How to setup your fork repository in Qbraid

1. ## On this GitHub repository, press the fork button

    You should now have a repository of your own. This is what you will submit.

2. ## Get the Clone URI

    **IN YOUR PERSONAL FORK** press the **Code** button, then make sure the Local and **HTTPS** options are selected. Copy the URL there, as you will need it it step 5.
    
4. ## Making a Qbraid account

    In case you do not have a Qbraid account, go to [Qbraid](https://account.qbraid.com/) and create a one

5. ## Open your lab

   Press **"Launch Lab"**. If asked, select the "Free 2vCPU 4GB RAM" option. You should be redirected to a very purple tab which will eventually open your lab.

6. ## Clone the fork

   Go to the **Git** tab on the left of the screen, and press **Clone a Repository**. You will be asked to provide the URL you got in step 2. 

7. ## Set up the Environment

   Go to the **ENVS** tab on the right, press **+ ADD**, and search for **Qiskit (v1.2.0)**. Make sure to install it.

8. ## Open the file

   Now that you have a repository, navigate to **StuyQuantumQiskitFallFest2024_Stage1.ipynb** and make sure the bar at the top says **`Python 3 [Qiskit 1.2.0]`**. If not, you will most likely have **`Python 3 [default]`**. If so, or if you have anything else that is like that, press it to open a menu, where you can select **`Python 3 [Qiskit 1.2.0]`** as the file's environment.


## You should now be good to go!
